### Hey, I'm Bryan Ramos ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at Microsoft where I work with Kubernetes and C# on the Catalog team. On my free time, I continue learning about React, the MS stack, mobile app development and more.

* Ask me about React, TypeScript, Azure, SQL, PHP and the Microsoft Stack.
* Need help with interviews or your resume? (Especially for Microsoft). Ping me on LinkedIn.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanramos/).
